We are the Gopi-65 team of Ruthrapriya, Lavanya, and Jayanth. I appreciate the Opportunity.That was fun learning! ESWAP is a website and mobile application that we created.
Eswap is a community forum for Vit college students.

Students can trade electronic parts.

They can buy or sell components.

When they search for a component, it will display its availability as well as the contact information of the person who owns it. Any student may use the sell option to sell their component, which will update the stock.
